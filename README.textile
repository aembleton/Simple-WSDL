A developer should be able to generate Java source files from WSDL much like you can with java2wsdl.  But rather than creating a difficult to modify file that makes use of a lot of classes to wrap each of the different elements, it is intended to make the resulting source as compact as possible.  If there is just a requirement to send a couple of Strings then, this will be all that is required - two setters will be generated.  Rather than providing the mechanism by which to send the request, Simple WSDL will just generate the XML for you and then you can send it yourself.  It will also be possible to get the SOAPAction so that you can send that in your request too.
